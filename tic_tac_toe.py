The Negamax algorithm is a variant of Minimax that's frequently used in real world
implementations.

A two-player game is usually a zero-sum game, which means that one
player's loss is equal to another player's gain and vice versa.

Negamax uses this property extensively to come up with a strategy to increases its chances of
winning the game. In terms of the game, the value of a given position to the first player is
the negation of the value to the second player. Each player looks for a move that will maximize
the damage to the opponent. The value resulting from the move should be such that the opponent
gets the least value.
This works both ways seamlessly, which means that a single method can be
used to value the positions. This is where it has an advantage over Minimax in terms of
simplicity. Minimax requires that the first player select the move with the maximum value,
whereas the second player must select a move with the minimum value.
